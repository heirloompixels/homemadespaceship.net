Today I noticed the first pomegranate starts from the cuttings I planted back in February.  I started a whole row of cuttings in late Feb before the buds started forming on the mother plant.  The cuttings were about 6 inches long and then stuck half of the way into the ground.  A liberal dose of mulching was applied and the area kept moist.  Some of the others seem to be forming buds as well!
