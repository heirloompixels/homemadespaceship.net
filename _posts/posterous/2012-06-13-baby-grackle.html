<p>Yesterday evening a chorus of angry Grackles that flew through our yard, landing on the wires above the alley. ??The neighborhood cruiser cat, a shabby orange fellow, had taken one of the Grackle fledglings and was fixing to have a hardy dinner of it. ??The cat sat, pinning the baby to the dirt with one paw as it looked up at the flock. ??The baby was flapping its small, undeveloped wings, so we ran over and the cat ran off chased by the flock. ?? The baby didn't even have a scratch, but the flock was no where to be seen. ??We left it hopping around the weeds in the alley for a while hoping the momma would come back, but she didn't. ??As it was getting dark we went and gently scooped it up so the cat wouldn't come back for it, hoping the mom would come back in the morning. ?? Our little baby Grackle spent the night sleeping in a straw filled box and at the crack of dawn we heard the mom calling for it. ?? She bought it food a few times in the box, the baby hopped out and followed the momma, hopping back to its tree in the neighbors yard.??</p>
