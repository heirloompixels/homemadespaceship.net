<p>It is that time of the year again. Time to smell the earth, feel the soft green moss between your toes, crawl beneath the trees in search of the mysterious, beautiful and (most of all) delicious mushrooms. ??We have been devouring a most awesome book (actually two) by David Arora, 'Mushrooms Demystified' and 'All That the Rain Promises, and More...A Hip Pocket Guide to Western Mushrooms". ?? Weather you like to eat mushrooms, or not, they are AWESOME, brilliant and hilarious books.</p>
