<p>It had to happen. ??Even in the desert it rains, and this fall/winter seems to be raining more than usual, which had lead to our tiny home to leak...a lot. ??Sky lights ALWAYS leak. So we have torn them both off, and are re-working the whole roof. ??Now, instead of two lights, there will be but one. ??But, the one will become a porthole to the world above, and the space where the other light once sat will become a roost for one lucky person...or maybe a step-stool up into the trees.</p>
