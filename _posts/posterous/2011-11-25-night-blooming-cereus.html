<p>Everyone should see this amazing plant once in their lives. ??It is a Night Blooming Cereus, it blooms only once, at night, and by morning the bud is wilted. The plant itself is awesomely unruly, it sends tendrils and leaves shooting off in all directions and will take over half a room if you let it. ??One morning I was standing near it talking with my grandma and she was saying how she wanted to chuck out the plant because it hadn't bloomed in a long time...the next day there were FIVE (usually there are only one or two) buds protruding from the leaves. ??Within a week the flowers grew to maturity and bloomed. ??Awesome! </p>
