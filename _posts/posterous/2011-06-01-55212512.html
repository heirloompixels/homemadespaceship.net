<p>We've been wanting for a long time to get some information up on the exact methods we used when building our trailer. &nbsp;This will take some time and in the end I'll dedicate a few pages to it - but for now I'm going to share the rough drafts of this "how-to" on the blog. &nbsp;Any feedback would be much appreciated so that I might write these descriptions better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far our techniques are holding up quite well and I have no reservations in recommending them to other people pursuing such a project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much credit is due where it is deserved - most of our methods were learned though many hours of searching the archives of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mikenchell.com/forums/" title="Teardrop Forum" target="_blank">teardrop forum</a>. &nbsp;There is a massive wealth of information there along with some really cool trailers. &nbsp;There is no way we would have finished this project without the knowledge so freely shared in those archives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part 1: &nbsp;Building the walls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal here is twofold - lightweight and high strength. &nbsp;I wanted from the get go to keep the trailer as light as possible so that it would be easier to haul around the country. &nbsp;I looked at a lot of more traditional building methods and really thought about building more along these lines - but the teardrop shape really caught us from the beginning - and to build the teardrop there really was no choice but to go with plywood. &nbsp;I have a sort of love/hate relationship with this material as it is not "natural" but at the same time it's amazing - truly a wonder and opens up such possibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The walls are basically "foam-core" - 1/4 inch plywood with 3/4 inch foam insulation sandwitched inbetween. &nbsp;Two walls are built as "units" and then attached to the trailer as whole pieces. &nbsp;By laminating the foam to the wood we were able to create a super strong wall - there was very little motion when wiggling it on edge or carrying it around. &nbsp;At the same time the walls are very lightweight - Jeannie and I were able to carry them with no effort at all.</p>
<p>In order to finish off the edges 1x3 spars are used. &nbsp;These are run all round the whole whole and in the middle as well to provide places to screw into. &nbsp;For the curved portions the 1x3's were kerfed - some experimenting and adjustment was needed to figure out how often and how much to kerf.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The shape was decided upon my trial and error. &nbsp;We laid out the three pieces of plywood which made up our walls. &nbsp;As it was the wood we found was 5x4' - which fit perfectly on our 12x5' trailer. &nbsp;We selected the wood very carefully at the lumber yard - went through the entire stack in fact in order to find grain patters we liked and which fit well with the other pieces. &nbsp;Back to the shape - we used chalk to draw out the shape - then would step back and look at the shape - erase and readjust, look, readjust, look, readjust... you get the idea. &nbsp;We spent a bit of time on this as we wanted the arcs to be just so. &nbsp;Agreed upon Jeannie whom is the power tool master went to work and cut the arcs. &nbsp;Once the first one was ready the arcs were transfered to the remaining 3 wall sections (2 on each side of the foam) and these were all cut as well - so that we had 4 matching wall pieces. &nbsp;</p>

<p>All that is left now is to glue everything together. &nbsp;We did this indoors as it was October and the temperatures were getting below freezing at night - not good for the glue which needs 24 hours&nbsp;above 40 degrees&nbsp;to cure. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is an obvious order here to the glueing - when working on the sparing you've got to keep cutting to fit the spaces you find. &nbsp;After the sparing is glued in place you can cut the foam to fit the voids and then glue the whole thing together.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>

<p>The sparing on the arcs is glued first.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img src="/images/309frontSpar.jpg.scaled1000.jpg">

<p>Then finish up the sparing for the rest of the walls.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img src="/images/310badGlue.jpg.scaled1000.jpg">

<p>Fit and glue the foam in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<div class="p_embed p_image_embed"><img src="/images/311PA269027.JPG.scaled1000.jpg">
</div>
<p>Then add the top walls and weight the whole thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When glueing all this in place you need to use weight to create a good fit. &nbsp;Unless you own a clamp factory the best option is to find everything available which is heavy - books are great as are plants. &nbsp;When this doesn't provide enough clamping force you can make nice big weights by filling things with water. &nbsp;Buckets, storage bins or even a whole bunch of old milk jugs. &nbsp;Water weighs 8 pounds per gallon so it doesn't take long to get enough heavy objects to provide nice even clamping force on your walls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The glue aside:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Titebond III is the nicest glue to work with - and you can buy big 32 once bottles for around 10 dollars so it is very economical as well. It's waterproof and has a longer open time which gives you a bit of leaway and greatly reduces stress when building. &nbsp;It also cleans up with a damp rag or water on your hands. Titebond III is also stronger than Gorrilla glue. &nbsp;(*does not taste good)</p>
<p>Gorrilla Glue can be used when gluing wood to most things wood. &nbsp;The down side is it foams and makes a mess most of the time and is really had to clean up. &nbsp;Get it on your hands and you've got to use a solvent to clean it off. &nbsp;Plus it's a lot more expensive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>PL 3000 is a specialty glue for use with foam insulation. &nbsp;We tested both titebond III and Gorrilla glue and they peal right off the foam. &nbsp;It stinks, comes in chaulk tube form and is expensive - but it does the job at hand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And finally you have two walls - just waiting to be assembled into a trailer!&nbsp;</p>
