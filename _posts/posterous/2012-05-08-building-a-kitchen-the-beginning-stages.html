<p>Our 100 year old house needs work...lots of work. ??We are working from the outside in, so we begin with the walls, which are just hollow cavities, no insulation, just air. ?? Opting out of using plastics and other such man-made materials, we are filling our walls with a light-straw-clay mixture. ?? After tearing down the sheetrock we packed the walls with the straw/clay mixture - 10% clay, 90% straw - toss it like a giant salad in a tarp and pack it in. ??We allowed it to dry for one week per inch of thickness...so after four weeks it is time for our first layer of plaster.??</p>

<div>With the mud we mix a generous helping of Cattail fluff. ??It makes an amazingly smooth and strong plaster.??</div>
