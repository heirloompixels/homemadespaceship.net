<p>A long anticipated project came to fruition today. &nbsp;Indigo dyeing! &nbsp;</p>
<div>The dye bath was mixed, and the 'flower' formed on top, the reaction of indigo dye with oxygen. &nbsp;The yarn was dipped, soaked, removed and hung on the clothed line to dry. &nbsp;When it first emerges from the dye vat, the yarn/fabric is green, only when it is exposed to oxygen during the drying process that it turns to it's classic indigo-blue color.</div>

<div>Kyle was so excited to be dyeing with indigo, he threw his shorts into the pot too.&nbsp;</div>

<div>We did not expect the color to be so vibrant - blue it sure is. &nbsp;Can't wait to start teaming up indigo dye with sage brush to make a nice yellow-green as well as cochineal and madder for some purples. &nbsp;The possibilities are really quite endless!</div>
