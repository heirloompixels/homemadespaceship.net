<div>The onion skins were added to a few gallons of water and left to boil on the stove for an hour or so.??Then I added alum and ammonia as the mordants for this dye bath. ??</div>

<div>I left the scarf in the dye bath all afternoon, stirring occasionally. ??Once it reached the color I wanted I pulled it out of the dye bath and left it in a plastic bag for 24 hours to fully set. ??After this it was rinsed thoroughly...and its ready to go.</div> <p></p>

<div>A Tip - If you are wanting to dye with onion skins, go to the grocery store and collect the skins at the bottom of the onion bins. ??People look at you funny, but its all in the name of art.??</div> <p></p>
