<span style="border-collapse: collapse;">This article I found so eloquently describes a bit of why I believe in the importance of textiles and clothing, not just as an inanimate, history-less object that we use to serve us, but as integral part of our lives and conscious beings on this planet. ??It DOES matter what you use to cloth and shelter yourself with. (and feed yourself...but that is another topic)<br></span><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br></span>

<span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">This is a snippet of an article I found in Surface Design Journal winter 2001 by??</span><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"></span><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Vernal Bogren Swift, The Fabric of Orientation.??</span>

<span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">?? ????</span><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">'I want to talk in metaphor about??</span><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">home, and about our work, which is the making of, or the embellishing, of cloth. ?? I regard cloth as a metaphor for land. ??And land is, of course, the place where we make a home.??</span>
</div> <div><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">?? ?? In geographical language, land is folded, sheeted and pleated. ??Land has seams and pockets. ??These domestic words reach from the linen closet of the house all the way to the deepest tunnels of the underground....men pick re from seams and pockets of an underground fabric. ??And although the ore can be taken from those seams, that ore will remember home and will one day return. ??The way this happens is be rusting. ??Iron ore is hematite. ??Rust is also hematite. ??Hematite ore can travel to Detroit and be made into steel. ??For about as long as a dog's life, the steel is quiescent and makes a nice looking car. ??Then one day, maybe a spring day after a winter on salted roads, the steel takes a breath. ??Literally, the steel begins to rust and will go all the way home again; breathing and rusting. ??I believe most physical objects have a physical memory of their early life.</span></div> <div>
<span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"></span><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">?? ?? Like cloth. ??Does cloth remember what it was? ??Does mercerized, bleached, sized stuff retain memory? ??I think it probably does....So I can suppose the cotton material...remembers when it was a green plant. ??When cotton was a green plant, it breathed. Not now. ??For the moment, this cloth is not breathing, or literally breathing. ??But rust breathes, doesn't it? ??If I put rust to cloth, will the cloth remember anything about breathing? ??I put hematite on the cloth, and salt it up and wait to see....'(in reference to dying cloth with natural, living materials) ??</span><p></p>
