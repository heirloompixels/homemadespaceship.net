<p>This is an awesome recipe that was cooked for us recently, and it was AWESOME. ??Just thought I'd share the pancake love!</p>
<p></p>
<div>From the 1945 'Woman's Home Companion Cook Book'....here we go.</div> <p></p>
<div>Flour, 1/2 cup (Gluten free mix, or all purpose)</div>
<div>Salt, 1 teaspoon</div>
<div>Sugar, teaspoon</div>
<div>Eggs, well beaten, 3</div>
<div>Milk, 3 cups</div>
<div>Butter, melted, 3 Tablespoons</div> <p></p>
<div>-mix flour, salt and sugar. (since we are no longer in the days of needing to sift flour...I left it out)</div>
<p></p>
<div>-To the beaten eggs add milk and melted butter; pour into flour mixture and stir until combined.??</div> <p></p>
<div>-Bake on hot greased griddle, using about 1/2 cup batter to make large cakes 8 to 9 inches in diameter.??</div>
<p></p>
<div>-Pile the pancakes like a layer cake on a big plate, pouring syrup (or jelly, honey or what ever suits your fancy) between each layer. ??Cut into pie shaped pieces to serve, and top with more good things.??</div>
