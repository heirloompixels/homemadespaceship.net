<p>So here we begin...cutting the new growth of the Salt Cedar trees along the Rio Grande. ??Salt Cedar is an invasive species that sucks up the water table and takes over. ??It is best to collect the branches early in the spring before they green-out and turn into big green brooms.??</p>

<div>The larger poles make great fence posts and the new growth will be used to weave back and forth to create the wall. ?? We dug the post holes about three feet down, tamping the posts in very well as the wind gets a bit crazy here sometimes.??</div> </div>

<div>Projects always take longer than expected...we had to finish weaving the next day.??</div>

<div>Once it was all woven, we made a cob mixture of clay from our back yard, a bit of sand and organic matter - leaves and dry grass. ??This is the first layer used in sculpting the wall.??</div> <p></p>

<div>The second layer to smooth, seal and further sculpt is just clay and cattail fluff. The plant fiber is necessary so as the clay dries it doesn't crack and fall off - it absorbs the shrinkage and strengthens the plaster. ?? We collected bags of cattails from the marsh along the Rio. ?? SUCH AWESOME MUD!!!!!!</div> <p></p>

<div>The wall - not quite finished, but it's getting there - still needs a final sealing layer so it doesn't melt in the monsoon. ??Comes complete with peep-holes. ??In the end we plan to paint it with earth pigments that we find out in the mountains.....more photos when that comes to pass.??</div> <p></p>
