<p>that simple little place where we could live and keep our stuff is what it is, this thing, home?&nbsp;What have we been missing and where have we been?&nbsp;What has come and gone and what have we missed?&nbsp;Our home is each other, that is simple. but we still need a roof over our heads. The thing is, now that we live in the homeland &ndash; don&rsquo;t know the exact location yet &ndash; and even then we are nomadic we are gypsies of a sort, still looking for our tribe but we are home. Shelter then, might be a more fitting word, but even then i don&rsquo;t think so. It&rsquo;s more than just a shelter, more than a roof over our heads, i mean the walls absorb our energy as much as we use their protection. It&rsquo;s a home, too, it&rsquo;s the addition to our lives a space we might grow together in and laugh in and cry and take another turn on the solar wheel and make some stuff. there is always that. The urge to create, the craft, the art. so it&rsquo;s that, a workshop with a bed. And a kitchen when the sun is too hot or the rain to cold and it&rsquo;s a big closet for too many raw materials &ndash; a dump truck of high fashion. it&rsquo;s a home in the least, that is for sure and we are building it ourselves, daily.</p>
