<p>We just wanted to say thanks to everyone for the emails and comments. ??Since Kirsten posted our video we have gotten a lot more visitors on our site and we are really happy to converse with people about what we are doing. ????</p>

<div>We are especially grateful to Kirsten at <a href="http://faircompanies.com">http://faircompanies.com</a> for making the video and doing such a good job of it. ??We just sent her a whole bunch of random clips and never thought they could ever fit into such a cohesive story. ??She really worked magic. ??Even more importantly she thought up the whole topic and project/series of videos.??</div> <p></p>
<div>From our end we will keep faithfully updating our story on this blog - especially it's motivating to see more people visiting. ??We are headed north from Colorado to Montana so if anyone is in this vicinity and might like to see the fort up close email us and we will see how it could be worked into our map. ?? ??</div> <p></p>
<div>So how about this diesel trike, from diu, India:??</div>
