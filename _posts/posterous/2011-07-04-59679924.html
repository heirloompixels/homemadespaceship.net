<p>At last, after a month of movement and visiting, on a beautiful, calm, sunny Montana afternoon I began to warp up the loom. ??But, of course as it must go, as soon as I was half way through with the warping, the wind picks up and howls at over 40mph, a storm blows in and begins to rain. Arg. ??So I finally got to finish this morning...and it it awesome.</p>
