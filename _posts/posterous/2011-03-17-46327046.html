<p>Mission complete. ??Finally we made it to the one place that eluded us on our mega hike. The Santa Theresa wilderness. When we did our hike from Apache Junction (Phoenix) to Truth or Consequences, NM, we walked around them instead of through them as it allowed us to carry two days less of food, and we still had 5 days and a whole other mountain range (the Pinalinos) to walk over before getting to a town (Safford, AZ). ??On our way up into the mountains we passed two hikers who are walking the Grand Enchantment Trail now...they were opting out of going through the Sta. Theresa too.</p>
<p></p>
<div>The Santa Theresa mountains are truly mysterious and marvelous as we discovered on our backpacking trip that we just returned from. ??They are considered one of the most remote (if not the most) wilderness areas in America, and they have the highest density of mountain lions of anywhere in the country...although all we saw were tracks. Access was almost completely closed to them until recently, due to the fact that they are surrounded by private land. ??The road that is now open to access the mountains is...hellacious indeed.??</div> <p></p>
