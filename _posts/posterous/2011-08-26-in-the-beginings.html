<p>I was recently asked whose idea was it to build the fort.??</p>
<div>The answer...'both of us'.??</div>
<div>'Really?'</div>
<div>'Yea'</div>
<p></p>
<div>I suppose though that it must really have started at the very beginning, five years ago. ??Whose idea was it anyway? ??The very first time we talked, we sat up all night talking while eyeballing a Nat Geo centerfold world map, planning our route for hitch-hiking around the world, sitting in my dumpy apartment on my crusty orange couch. Five months later we were hitching a ride on a sail boat from Baja to the mainland Mexico...five months after that...we were in India. Thats is just how our ideas seem to go. ??They start with a small seed of an idea, and grow. They grow and evolve as we do, leading on to the next adventure. ?? Soon we will have a new seed to sew.??</div>
