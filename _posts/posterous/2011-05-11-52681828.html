<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse;">Here is the biggest and most delicate project yet. ??It is made of extremely fine wool threads that we sent home from India. ??They are from the town of Kalpa, in Kinnaur valley, and are used to weave the traditional blankets, shawls and fabric. ??I 2-plied the warp strings, and the weft strings I plied 5-8 times. ??It seems to be taking longer to ply the yarn than to weave it...although warping up the 442 strings in the wind was a bit of an epic challenge.</span> <p></p>
