<p>Besides dysentery.</p>
<div>Or an amoeba discotheque in your lower intestine.??<p></p>
<div>We are trying to build a small charcoal forge to use in silversmithing and blacksmithing - Kyle wants to make some adzes and other sharp things. ??Building a forge is very easy - all of the materials save one are simple and mostly free to acquire. ??That one odd ball is the bellows. We could build a bellows but it's very complicated and in the end it's very bulky and would take up a lot of space for a non essential item. Fortunately there is another alternative - the hand crank blower. ??In the United States these hand crank blowers were made by the Champion Blower company about 100 years ago. ??This simple item now, though, will set us back at least 150 bucks on ebay - not the cheapest "experiment" to build.??</div> </div>
<p></p>
<div>How this relates to India is though our friend Tevon. We met Tevon at one of our favorite guest houses in Dharamshala, India. ??He was on an Enfield and among the scant possessions he carried on this iron horse was a hand crank blower of the type commonly used throughout india by metal smiths and people cooking on fire alike. ??Tevon as it turns out had spent three days in Delhi tracking this little get down and had been carrying it around for the last two months just so he could take it home and use it for cooking fires someday. ??I think he paid a few hundred rupees for it - brand new.??</div> <p></p>
<div>This brings up the question of what did you bring home frond India. ??The first time I was there I brought home a backpack full of oil paint - two dollars for giant 200 ml tubes - I can do that. ??The next time it was shawls, lots and lots of shawls. ??Then there was that treadle powered surger we mailed home. ??Oh and can't forget the "round" package - two bamboo bowl baskets together with fabric in the middle. ??Last fall is was 200 pounds of raw silk - everything the airline would allow us to carry. ??We've got a couple of brass cooking pots like the old time dhabawalas use.??</div> <p></p>
<div>And most importantly - our tiffin - there is just nothing like a tiffin for carrying your lunch.??</div>
<p></p>
<div>So what did you bring home from India???</div>
