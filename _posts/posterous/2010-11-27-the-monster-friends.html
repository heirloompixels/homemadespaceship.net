<div>The Monster Friends come from a planet far far away. &nbsp;How far has yet to be determined as Monster Friends have a very hard time measuring things, but we'll get to that.&nbsp;</div>
<p></p>
<div>On their home planet Monster Friends are huge - bigger than anything. &nbsp;Bigger than the mountains, bigger than the buildings. &nbsp;Bigger by a million times than all the other people and animals. &nbsp;This bigness caused them to be very lonely on their home planet. &nbsp;Totally ostracized if you will. &nbsp;So the monster friends decided to leave.&nbsp;</div>
<p></p>
<div>The decision to leave was followed by months of searching for a new home planet. &nbsp;It was not easy and in fact hundreds of suitable homes were found. &nbsp;In the coarse of the search earth was considered but didn't really garner any special attention until elephants were seen. &nbsp;After this there was very little consideration taking place and it was quickly decided that Earth was the perfect new home for monster friends. &nbsp;You see, the Monster Friends really took a fancy to elephants and since on Earth elephants are so huge the Monster Friends decided they would make perfect pets. &nbsp;As Monster Friends are gigantic they thought elephants would be about the same as dogs are to humans.&nbsp;</div>
<p></p>
<div>A few more months of space ship construction was necessary and then the typical late night before we leave packing which is standard of those versed in interstellar travel, but finally the Monster Friends were off. &nbsp;It was a rather uneventful journey for the most part with some typical sight seeing, snapshots in front of the biggest cupcake of the andromeda galaxy and the "are we there yets" of the little ones, but finally the monster friends landed on earth.&nbsp;</div>
<p></p>
<div>And much to their surprise they were no longer huge. &nbsp;Some how during the space travel they had shrunk, something about magnetic fields and unshielded gamma rays. &nbsp;At least that is the best reasons offered by the top scientists of the Monster Friends, outside experts and analysts and all. &nbsp;In the humble opinion of me, your storyteller, I have a different take on it. &nbsp;The Monster Friends are in fact rather poor at measurements - it's just not their cup of tea. &nbsp;What I believe occurred is a simple slip of scale in their investigations of planet &nbsp;earth. &nbsp;As it turned out Earth is a lot bigger than their home planet and so they are a lot smaller on earth.&nbsp;</div>
<p></p>
<div>Just how small you might be wondering right now - well they still have gotten along with the elephants but instead of the elephants being their dogs, the Monster Friends now live in a symbiotic relationship on the elephants - inside the cracks of their skin!</div>
<p></p>
<div>All in all everything has turned out quite nice for the Monster Friends and they have set right to building an advanced civilization comparable to what they left on their ex planet. &nbsp;</div>
