<p>The wilderness of the American west. &nbsp; This is the place where we will roam, in our strange and marvelous caravan, living and creating &nbsp;under the sky. &nbsp;Our first deep look into the south-west was early last spring when we walked from the Superstition wilderness (just outside of Phoenix, AZ) to Truth or Consequences, NM. &nbsp;Walking around 20 miles every day we crossed Sonoran desert valleys, climbed over and through numerous mountain ranges, watching the landscape change beneath our feet. &nbsp;This is a land of harsh plenty and mystery.&nbsp;</p>
