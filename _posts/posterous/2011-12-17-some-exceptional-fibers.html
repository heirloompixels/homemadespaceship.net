<p>How to spin simply. ??You don't have a spindle? ??No problem. ??I did't ether when I acquired these awesome fibers...at last not one that was available, it was buried in storage. ??So...I found a knitting needle, and a lid from a coffee can...and away we went. ?? This is carbonized bamboo fiber, it is an amazing silky, lustrous fiber. This fiber was used by Edison as a light bulb filament. It is resistant to UV rays and has anti-odor properties.</p>
